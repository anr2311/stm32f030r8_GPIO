The repository contains the GPIO drivers developed from scratch towards the STM32F030R8 microcontroller based NUCLEO board.

The sample application code toggles the GPIO port A pin 5 (the on-board LED of the Nucleo board) and uses a SW delay of approximately ~7 seconds (**Bole jo koyal, baagon meinâ€¦**):
